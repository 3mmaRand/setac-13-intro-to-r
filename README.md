## Overview

This repository contains all materials for the "Introduction to
Reproducibility with R" workshop delivered at the SETAC 13th Young
Environmental Scientists Meeting. In this one-day session, you will be able to:

-   Find their way around the RStudio windows
-   Create and plot data using ggplot
-   Explain the rationale for scripting analysis
-   Know how to load packages
-   Understand what is meant by the working directory, absolute and
    relative paths and be able to apply these concepts to data import
-   Summarise data in a single group or in multiple groups
-   Develop highly organised analyses including well-commented scripts
    that can be understood by future you and others

This workshop is designed for beginners with no prior experience in R or
RStudio. It is suitable for environmental scientists, ecologists, and
anyone interested in learning how to use R for reproducible research.

Materials are organised as Quarto (`.qmd`) website: [Introduction to Reproducibility with R](https://3mmarand.github.io/setac-13-intro-to-r/).


## Pre-course instructions for participants

You do not need any prior experience of R or RStudio.

There are Windows PCs at the venue and you are **not** required to bring
your own machine. Participants from outside of York will be provided
with a temporary IT account. However, if you prefer to work on your own
machine please install the following prior to attending: 

-   R version 4.4.1 or higher:<https://cloud.r-project.org/>
-   RStudio Version: 2024.12.1+563 or higher:
    <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
-   These R packages from CRAN: **`tidyverse`**,  **`devtools`**.
    Once you have installed R and RStudio, start RStudio up and 
    go to the Packages tab in the bottom right pane; click Install and 
    type the name of the package you want to install in the box that 
    appears. Then wait until you get the cursor (\>) back in the 
    console window.
-   TinyTeX:
    Once you have installed R and RStudio, start RStudio up and 
    go to the Terminal (lower left, behind the console) and type:
    `quarto install tinytex` and press enter.
